*Written Assignments and Presentations*

- The specifications and deadlines for each written assignment are given in the description for each project.
- Presentations derived from time spent between classes and during in-class workshop on each PBL project.
- Initial submission and revised products are submitted by email, with the subject line GCWSassignment. Files should be renamed before submission to read GCWSxyProjectz + revised (when revised) where xy=your initials and z=the project number.
- Alternate which instructor you submit the initial submission to.
- Professional presentation of written submissions means typos and spelling mistakes are eliminated, pages are numbered, fonts are consistent, and references are cited in a consistent format.

*Participation Items*

- Attendance and participation in class meetings based on preparation between classes, including focal reading. Includes punctuality, no cell phone calls. (14 items)
- “Treasure Hunt”, to get familiar with organization of course materials and requirements
- Annotated reference or resource (such as a person, organization…) added at regular intervals to the evolving bibliography on the blog. (8 items)
    - Annotations should convey the article’s key points as well as its connection to the student’s own inquiries and interests. Examples from past years are provided. Prepare first on your computer, then copy and paste the annotated reference into blog. Specify the category "Bibliography".
- Reflection on your experience of the course process and your learning in the PBL format (at least 10 weekly entries, each worth ½ an item, adding up to maximum of 5 items)
    - Although posting the entries to the blog is optional, interaction between class meetings is valuable in this course because we are based on different campuses and because of the evolving nature of the PBL experience. Specify the posting category Reflection.
- Minimum of two in-person or phone conferences on your assignments and projects—one before class 5, the other, with the other instructor before class 10 (2 items). These are important for checking in, taking stock, getting a recharge, ensuring timely resolution of misunderstandings, and opening up significant issues about one’s relationship to the course material and objectives. If you are falling behind, conferences are especially important.
