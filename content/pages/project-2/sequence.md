## Class 5

Intersecting processes mapping of fictional text (activity based on Taylor 2010)

*Focal Reading*

Taylor, Peter J., and Frederick H. Buttel. "[How Do We Know We Have Global Environmental Problems? Science and the Globalization of Environmental Discourse](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016718592900515)." *Geoforum* 23, no 3 (1992): 405–416. 

*Prompt for Journal Entry (between Class 5 and 6)*

In project 2, as you move past "the first time" and start feeling more comfortable with the level of initiative and autonomy PBL requires, you might ask yourself this: "If I was invited to bend the course to my own particular needs, to stop waiting for "content" to appear, what might I do at this point?"

## Class 6

Work-in-progress presentations in small groups and extended discussion

*Focal Reading*

Last, Angela. "[Super-Natural Futures: One Possible Dialogue Between Afrofuturism and Anthropocene](https://mutablematter.wordpress.com/2013/08/13/super-natural-futures-one-possible-dialogue-between-afrofuturism-and-the-anthropocene/)." *Mutable Matter: Interdisciplinary Writing on Materiality*.
