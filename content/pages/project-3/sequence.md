## Class 8

Situational map (Clarke 2005) of selection of readings from bibliography provided by instructors

*Focal Reading*

Clarke, Adele E. "Doing Situational Maps and Analysis." *Situational Analysis: Grounded Theory After the Postmodern Turn.* SAGE Publications, Inc., 2005. ISBN:9780761930563

*Prompt for Journal Entry (between class 8 and 9)*

## Class 9

*Focal Reading*

Jesser, Nancy. "[Blood, Genes and Gender in Octavia Butler's *Kindred* and *Dawn*](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA87128335&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=00145483&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=mlin_oweb&isGeoAuthType=true&aty=geo)." *Extrapolation* 43, no. 1 (2002).

*Prompt for Journal Entry (between class 9 and 10)*

How does the focal reading connect with your (or depart from) your own work and how does it stimulate your own thinking and questioning?

## Class 10

Presentation of a class for this imagined course, a semester-long course project, or a toolbox of methods.

*Focal Reading*

Taylor, Peter J. "[Infrastructure and Scaffolding: Interpretation and Change of Research Involving Human Genetic Information](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09505430902946649)." *Science as Culture* 18, no. 4 (2009): 435–459. 

If you have read that already, watch  a video of the practice run of a talk to philosophers and biologists:

Taylor@ISHPSSB15. "[His nature, her nurture—or what good are conceptual critiques for tackling practical concerns about the development of gendered individuals?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE75Cf_8K34&feature=youtu.be)" YouTube. June 11, 2015. 

*Prompt for Journal Entry (between class 10 and 11)*
